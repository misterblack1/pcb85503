# Full length 8-bit ISA card PCB 85502 / Schematic 85503
I found this card in a 486SX/33 mini tower computer. I don't know what it does.

J1 connected to the PC speaker output on the motherboard. (The case speaker wasn't conencted to anything at all.)

Installing this into a computer does boot the system off the ROM on this card and it is looking for a CDROM or Floppy disk. (I don't have either) I have no other informatino about how this card was used.
