# Full length 8-bit ISA card PCB 85502 / Schematic 85503
I found this card in a 486SX/33 mini tower computer. I don't know what it does.

J1 connected to the PC speaker output on the motherboard. (The case speaker wasn't conencted to anything at all.)

Installing this into a computer does boot the system off the ROM on this card and it is looking for a CDROM or Floppy disk. (I don't have either) I have no other informatino about how this card was used.

To dump the ROMs, I set the programmer to 27512, as I didn't know how big these chips are. (27512 should be the maximum size in this footprint) It may result in some looking content if the chips are smaller than 27256, so let mek now if this is the case.
